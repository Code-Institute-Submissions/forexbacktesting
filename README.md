<h2>Context</h2>

A trainer from a trading company need a interactive simulators to explain to the novice about backtesting and moving average strategy.

```

```
```
Explaination:
**Moving averages** are the most basic technical strategy. The goal is to identify the trend's direction to capitalize on it. 
Traders believe when a short term average cross over a long term average, it shows the direction of the trend.
A upward trend is a buy signal and a downward trend is a sell signal.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

In this project I used **HTML5** to structure the webpages and **CSS3** to style them.

I uses **Git** for Versioning Control System and **GitHub** for repositories.

**Gitpod**, an online IDE, is my main coding platform. I do sometimes test out codes in **Repl.it**

The interativity is enabled by **Javascript** and it's libraries (**jQuery.js**, **axios.js**, **moment.js**, **Chart.js**), taking advantages of **DOM**, **Ajax** and **JSON**.
