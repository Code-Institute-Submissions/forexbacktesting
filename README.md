<h1>Currency Exchange Backtesting Project</h1>
<p>Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project</p>

<hr>

<h2>Context</h2>

A trainer for a trading company need an interactive simulator to explain to the novice about backtesting and moving average strategy.

```
Definition: 
**Backtesting** is a term used in modelling to refer to testing a predictive model on historical data. 
Backtesting is a type of retrodiction, and a special type of cross-validation applied to previous time period(s).
(Source: Wikipedia)
```
```
Explanation:
**Moving averages** are the most basic technical strategy. 
The goal is to identify the trend's direction to capitalize on it. 
Traders believe when a short term average cross over a long term average, 
it shows the direction of the trend.
An upward trend is a buy signal and a downward trend is a sell signal.
```

<h1>Defining the Project (Strategy)</h1>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>

The objective of this project is to develop a small application that allows the trainer to demonstrate how to do backtesting using moving average strategy to the trainee.

The trainer can also allow trainees to have some hands-on using the application.

Both the trainer and trainee are considered as the users of the application.

<h2>User Stories</h2>
* As a user, I want to selected time period to view that period's historical currency exchange rates, so that it can relfect realistic market condition. 
* As a user, I want to view the short term and long term moving average, so that I can identify the point where I should apply the moving average strategy to buy or sell.
* As a user, I want to simulate transactions (buying and selling), so that I know the outcome (profits or losses) after I apply the strategy.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

In this project I used **HTML5** to structure the webpages and **CSS3** to style them.

I uses **Git** for Versioning Control System and **GitHub** for repositories.

**Gitpod**, an online IDE, is my main coding platform. I do sometimes test out codes in **Repl.it**

The interativity is enabled by **Javascript** and it's libraries (**jQuery.js**, **axios.js**, **moment.js**, **Chart.js**), taking advantages of **DOM**, **Ajax** and **JSON**.
